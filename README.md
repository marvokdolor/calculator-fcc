## JavaScript Calculator - [freeCodeCamp Project](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator)

Welcome to my first React project!

I heavily borrowed from the [React docs](https://reactjs.org/).
I also used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to make the set up easier.

- [ ] Next step will be using responsive web design principles and front-end libraries like Bootstrap to make it much more usable and visually appealing.

- [ ] If I decide to make a public link, I do so using this great [reference](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/surge-vs-github-pages-deploying-a-create-react-app-project-c0ecbf317089).

If you're curious about my freeCodeCamp work please check out my [portfolio](https://codepen.io/marvokdolor/full/bmLbQy/) currently on CodePen, but moving to GitHub-pages in the coming months.
