## JavaScript Calculator - [freeCodeCamp Project](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator)

I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to make the set up easier.
And I used these references when I got stuck while building the app:
- https://github.com/therj/react-calculator/tree/master/src
- https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_eval.asp

- [ ] Next step will be using responsive web design principles and front-end libraries like Bootstrap to make it much more usable and visually appealing.

- [ ] Create a public [link](https://marvokdolor.github.io/calculator-fcc/), using this great [reference](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/surge-vs-github-pages-deploying-a-create-react-app-project-c0ecbf317089).

If you're curious about my freeCodeCamp work please check out my [portfolio](https://codepen.io/marvokdolor/full/bmLbQy/) currently on CodePen, but moving to GitHub-pages in the coming months.
